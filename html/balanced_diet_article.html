    <h1>How to Have a Balanced Diet</h1>
    <img src="../img/diet_article.jpeg" alt="Balanced Diet">

    <p>Maintaining a balanced diet is essential for good health, sustained energy, and preventing disease. It doesn't mean eating perfectly every day, but rather making consistent, smart choices.</p>

    <h2>1. Eat a Variety of Foods</h2>
    <p>No single food can provide all the nutrients your body needs. Include a wide range of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your meals.</p>

    <h2>2. Choose Whole, Natural Foods</h2>
    <p>Limit highly processed foods high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Cooking your meals at home is one of the best ways to eat better and stay in control of whatâ€™s in your food.</p>

    <h2>3. Stay Hydrated</h2>
    <p>Drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water daily. Try to reduce sugary drinks and alcohol. Water helps with digestion and energy levels.</p>

    <h2>4. Practice Mindful Eating</h2>
    <p>Eat slowly, without distractions like phones or TV. Listen to your hunger and fullness cues. Mindful eating helps prevent overeating and improves digestion.</p>

    <h2>5. Balance Your Plate</h2>
    <p>A balanced plate typically includes: half vegetables, one-quarter protein, and one-quarter complex carbohydrates (like whole grains).</p>

    <p>ðŸ’¡Judia's Advice : itâ€™s not about perfection, but progress. A balanced diet is built over time, not in one meal.</p>
