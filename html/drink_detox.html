    <h1>Natural Detox: What to Drink Daily?</h1>
    <img src="../img/detox_drinks.jpeg" alt="Natural detox drinks">

    <p>Every day, your body works to eliminate toxins naturally. But you can support this process with simple and healthy beverages that gently cleanse your system. Hereâ€™s what you can drink daily to help your body detox naturally.</p>

    <h2>1. Lemon Water</h2>
    <p>Start your day with warm water and fresh lemon juice. It stimulates digestion, supports liver function, and provides a boost of vitamin C. Drink it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.</p>

    <h2>2. Green Tea</h2>
    <p>Rich in antioxidants like catechins, green tea helps your body combat free radicals and supports the liver in flushing out toxins. It's also a great caffeine alternative.</p>

    <h2>3. Herbal Infusions</h2>
    <p>Herbs like dandelion, mint, ginger, or turmeric promote digestion and have anti-inflammatory properties. Enjoy them as teas during the day to soothe your system naturally.</p>

    <h2>4. Cucumber and Mint Water</h2>
    <p>Infused water with cucumber and mint is refreshing and hydrating. It helps flush out excess water and keeps your digestive system calm and cool.</p>

    <h2>5. Apple Cider Vinegar (Diluted)</h2>
    <p>A small amount of organic apple cider vinegar in water may support digestion, balance blood sugar, and aid detox. Use only 1â€“2 teaspoons in a large glass of water.</p>

    <p>ðŸ’¡Ambre's Tip: Detox drinks should always complement a healthy, balanced diet â€” not replace meals! Stay hydrated, eat clean, and let your body do its natural work!</p>
